==bitsyBBS==
bitsyBBS is a web-based Bulletin Board System that achieves a refreshingly simple layout, while being powerful "under the hood," in an age where web design is blighted by bloat, clutter, and hassles(like forced/coerced registration). Drawing inspiration from the simplicity pre-internet BBS, bitsyBBS creates a hassle-free, un-cluttered, un-facebook experience that is beautiful sheer minimalism.
